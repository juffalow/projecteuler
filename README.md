# Go lang and ProjectEuler.net

I was reading the e-book [An introduction to programming in Go](https://www.golang-book.com/books/intro) and in the end there is a suggestion to practise coding on challenging programming problems and as an example [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net) is mentioned.

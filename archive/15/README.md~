# (Lattice paths)[https://projecteuler.net/problem=15]

This is a "combination problem". The way down from the up left corner to the bottom right corner has to take 40 steps. 20 right steps and 20 down steps. That means, we want to count all possible ways down disregarding when the move right comes.
For this we use Binomial Coefficient formula "n choose k", i. e. C(n, k) => C(40, 20) => and that is the right result.
